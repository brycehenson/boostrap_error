## To Do
- Documentation
- allow second output from anal_opp function (to be used as a structure of details about the fit)
  - allow for this second output not to be provided
- provide all these second outputs in a cell matrix
- test for sub datasets
- test biasing for non gaussian distribution
- write out as tutorial
- normalily testing
